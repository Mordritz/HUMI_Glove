## Abstract - Our Objective
Over the past decades, systems for interacting with machines has been developed and implemented in a
way that machines can understand. As humans, we’ve had to learn how to use those systems in order to
control the machines, however unnatural they may be.

Take drone control for instance; If you were given a drone, and were told to control it in a way that felt
most natural - would folding your hands around a plastic box and moving your thumbs around in small
circles be your preferred method of doing it?

We don’t think so. And neither does Kevin Ford.


## Timeline

### Week 2 
Finishing presentation to class.

### Week 3 
Meeting with CTO. Setting up programing environment. Get SDK (Software Development Kit).

### Week 4 
Test SDK, get familiarized with the environment (programming environment).

### Week 5 
Test current control algorithms, and we start altering them and creating new and improved
methods.

### Week 6 
Continue creating, improving, testing, analyzing different control algorithms.

### Week 7 
Finalizing new algorithms and putting them into place.

### Week 8 
Test flight with new and improved modules.

### Week 9
Learn from test flight, improve/tweak algorithms in place.

### Week 10
Retest, and FLY!
